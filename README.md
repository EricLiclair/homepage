# A personalized Default Homepage for browsers

#### "They say, when you can not find something you need, build it for yourself."
<br>

### What was the need?
All I wanted was a default homepage which would have all my favourites and shortcuts at one place and **strictly no recommendations** with some graphics and animations.
Surfed the chrome store for certain themes and extensions, same for the microsoft edge too. But I couldn't find anything that worked for me.

Finally I decided to build one for myself.
<br>

### What all is in on the page?
- A welcome section with some texts of various precedence. (In my case, it happens to be a hello message and a quick intro to myself)
- Next is the shortcuts section which contains my favourite and most useful links<br>
**github.com** (imagine what it would be without github ‚ù§)<br>
**google.com** (just in case I am on a different browser)<br>
**youtube.com** (learning should never stop)<br>
**youtube.com** (melody keeps me going)
- Next is a message board which works in handy for certain notes or quick todo tasks.<br>
> This can store secret texts too, and because the data is stored in the local storage of your pc/laptop, someone on the web can not see it<br>(do not keep your crush's name there üòÇ) Go ahead to the `index.js` and find out how the secret storage works ‚úå
- Next is quick links to **gmail** and **chrome-apps** (do not forget to change the link to apps to `chrome://apps`)
- Finally a few svg's which slides in as and when you hover over the shortcut links.

### Personalizing for yourself?
Nothing super difficult needs to be done. Just clone the repo, navigate to the html and change the content as you like and some css.
